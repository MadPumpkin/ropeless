# Ropeless
Ropeless is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for logical text manipulation and behaves as a sequence of functional operations on a sequence or series of sequences of inputs. Ropeless is a logical constraint language at heart and must be equiped with a faculty of rule compositions by which to reduce and unify at proving time. Ropeless has no concept of infinite loops, statements reducing to things like `while(true)` will be converted to "just true" by configuration, or "just false" by convention. Ropeless takes inputs from some source stream, applies a sequence of filters, maps, reductions, and other manipulations to it and outputs the result to some target stream. It can be thought of as a three step process built from a single composable pipelined type, where the middle step may be finitely many intermediate steps, and inputs and outputs may be given as lists for parallel or sequential execution.
