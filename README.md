# Ropeless
Ropeless is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for logical text manipulation and behaves similarly to a EBNF compiler which has it's primary operator augmented with an input vector. Ropeless has with very few operators and infinite loops are not allowed, therefore not all types of programs can be written in Ropeless. Ropeless should be provided a universe of rules and transformations (rule equivalencies/statements can be understood as reduction or transitions) and then provided various input text sources. Finally, a goal is established and you may use it to report the completed string, or complete the string only up until some transition step and export it. Ropeless can also be used in this way within a command-line centric pipeline to help in producing intermediate inputs to various commands, as well as a standalone code generating platform.
